# Creating your own MyToken and running your own MyCrowdsale

Below I will demonstrate how to create your own ERC20 compliant token and write smartcontracts for the token and token sale.

## Getting Started

I will be using [Truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle), an Ethereum development environment. Please install Truffle.

```sh
npm install -g truffle

```

To install this project, run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mandys/myToken.git
npm install
```

The code also relies on the zepplein solidity contracts provided by the Open Zepplin team.
When you run npm install these should automatically be fetched for you and placed under node_modules.

They can be deployed to testrpc

Donations can be made using MetaMask
